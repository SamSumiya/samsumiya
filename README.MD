Hi - I'm Sam Sumiya ðŸ‘‹ a software engineer. I have an undergraduate degree in Law and a Masters in International Relations. Professionally I worked as an agency recruiter in Tokyo working with Japanese and English candidates and organizations and when I moved to the Bay Area in 2019, I soon realized my dream of becoming a software developer.
