  Hi - I'm Sam Sumiya ðŸ‘‹ a software engineer. I have an undergraduate degree in Law and a Masters in International Relations. Professionally I worked as an agency recruiter in Tokyo working with Japanese and English candidates and organizations and when I moved to the Bay Area in 2019, I soon realized my dream of becoming a software developer.
<br/>
I have spent the past year focused on becoming a software engineer and study a lot in my free time new concepts beyond the course material and am excited to help an organization scale.

When I am learning something new. In my free time I love to check out new places to eat with my friends and also practice kickboxing ~ ask me about my professional fight in Thailand, I'd love to tell you more.
